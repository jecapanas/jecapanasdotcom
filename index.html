    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is my very first website, I am running it in order to practice my web development skills as I learn.<br>
        I am teaching myself how to build a website from scratch, and as I go through my lessons, I hope to apply what I learn here.<br>
        I hope this site will start looking much more interesting soon...
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for visting, have a nice day. </p>
    <p>- Jude Enrique Capanas</p>

                    <p>Today I finished the section of the module on text formatting and styling. If you're seeing this around the date of when this update was posted, you'll see that it has way more content on it now with some additional formatting to make it a bit more presentable. Of course, it's only basic for now, but I'm sure it will get better. Hey, I even managed to put these updates in a neat little table for you.</p>
                    <p>I'm excited to see how far I can take this website. Maybe it will look all fancy like those popular blogs. But I want to avoid using stuff like WordPress or whatnot, and focus on learning to do it all myself. Of course, I want to learn how to make it more interactive and dynamic. I'll try to learn JavaScript and React later on, but that's far far far into the future. For now, <q>early-2000s</q> will be the aesthetic.</p>
                    <p>Also, it's Friday the 13<super>th</super> today. OooOOOoOoOooooOoo~~~</p>

                    <p>So I'm not starting completely from scratch, I do have some basic understanding of HTML from previous experience. But I am reteaching myself through <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/training-certifications/training/netacad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cisco Networking Academy</em></a>.</p>
                    <p>Right now, I just finished learning about the basic stucture, tags, and attributes of HTML. I'm also dipping my toes bit inot CSS, but I will be taking a separate class on that after completing this one. Regardless, I think it's more exciting learning it on my own.</p>
                    <p>As of the moment, I'm putting these updates up manually by editing the source code. But maybe down the line, I could build this site to be like a blog, and I can post the updates in a cleaner manner. For now, I'll just try to keep the most recent updates on top.</p>
