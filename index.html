    <h1>Greetings!</h1>
    <p>
        This is my very first website, I am running it in order to practice my web development skills as I learn.<br>
        I am teaching myself how to build a website from scratch, and as I go through my lessons, I hope to apply what I learn here.<br>
        I hope this site will start looking much more interesting soon...
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for visting, have a nice day. </p>
    <p>- Jude Enrique Capanas</p>

            <p>So I'm not starting completely from scratch, I do have some basic understanding of HTML from previous experience. But I am reteaching myself through <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/training-certifications/training/netacad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco Networking Academy</a>.</p>
            <p>Right now, I just finished learning about the basic stucture, tags, and attributes of HTML. I'm also dipping my toes bit inot CSS, but I will be taking a separate class on that after completing this one. Regardless, I think it's more exciting learning it on my own.</p>
            <p>As of the moment, I'm putting these updates up manually by editing the source code. But maybe down the line, I could build this site to be like a blog, and I can post the updates in a cleaner manner. For now, I'll just try to keep the most recent updates on top.</p>
