    <h1>Greetings!</h1>
    <p>
        This is my very first website, I am running it in order to practice my web development skills as I learn.<br>
        I am teaching myself how to build a website from scratch, and as I go through my lessons, I hope to apply what I learn here.<br>
        I hope this site will start looking much more interesting soon...
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for visting, have a nice day. </p>
